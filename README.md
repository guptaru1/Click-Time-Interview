# Click-Time-Interview

Write a calculator program in Java or C# that evaluates expressions in a very simple integer expression language. The program takes an input on the command line, computes the result, and prints it to the console. For example:

Expressions
Numbers: Integers between Integer.MIN_VALUE and Integer.MAX_VALUE

Arithmetic functions: add, sub, mult, div, each taking two arbitrary expressions as arguments. In other words, each argument may be any of the expressions on this list.
